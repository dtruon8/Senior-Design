AAC Diagnostic Tool

The web app can be accessed only on the LSU wifi at capstone.ece.lsu.edu due to the server only being hosted by LSU. 

Currently, the web application is using the code in the 'pub' folder. This includes the home, assessment, and assessment summary page. Tentatively, the web app was going to have the login, registration, and password recovery features, but due to time constraints and a bad team composition, we failed in our endeavors. Also, we had the idea of creating an algorithm for assigning a patient to an AAC device from the selected assessment answers, but that also did not work out. For next year's LSU Senior Design Class, we would like this project to flourish and be the best it could be to help Speech-Language Pathologists in the diagnostic process for assigning an appropriate AAC device for their patients. Below is the user manual for the web app.
